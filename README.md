It's a simple app which lets the user register themself and become a writer. This app has a lot of features like rich text editor, comments, clean ui, 2fa, login with email/usernam, etc.

I created in means of learning things more in-depth. This project was so fun. It's now available as public and you can use my project or contribute if u think u can improve anything. You can modify this project and use it eleswhere, just mention me please if u use this project.

Thanks
